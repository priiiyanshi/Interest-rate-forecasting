# Interest-rate-forecasting & Yield Curve Shock Simulator
A web app that forecasts interest rate movements using ARIMA/LSTM models.

A simple MVP built using Streamlit to forecast interest rates using ARIMA & LSTM 
and run shock scenarios (+50bps, +100bps) for ALM and risk evaluation.

Features:
- Upload CSV time-series data
- ARIMA-based forecasting
- Basic LSTM forecasting (extendable)
- Shock simulations for rate movements
- Interactive charts

Built for demonstrating quantitative risk analytics skills.
